        +-------------------+
```


In the diagram:
- (PK) denotes the primary key of the entity.
- (FK) denotes the foreign key referencing the primary key of another entity.


The relationships between the entities are as follows:
- Each "JobVacancy" can have multiple "Applications" (one-to-many relationship).
- Each "Application" can have multiple "Interviews" (one-to-many relationship).


**5. Pictorial Representation**


Here's a pictorial representation connecting the tables based on the relationships:


```
    +-----------------+        +-----------------+        +-----------------+
    |   JobVacancy    |        |   Application   |        |    Interview    |
    +-----------------+        +-----------------+        +-----------------+
    | VacancyID (PK)  |        | ApplicationID   |        | InterviewID (PK)|
    | JobTitle        |        | VacancyID (FK)  |        | ApplicationID   |
    | Description     |        | ApplicantName   |        | InterviewDate   |
    | Qualifications  | 1    N | ContactInfo     | 1    N | InterviewTime   |
    | Status          | ------ | WorkExperience  | ------ | Interviewer     |
    +-----------------+        | Education       |        | Notes           |
                              | Resume/CV       |        +-----------------+
                              | Status          |
                              +-----------------+
```


The diagram shows the relationships between the "JobVacancy," "Application," and "Interview" entities. Each relationship is labeled with the cardinality (1 to N) and the corresponding foreign key (FK). This pictorial representation provides a visual overview of how the tables are connected in the Employee Recruitment System.

In the above diagram, the arrows indicate the relationships between the entities. The relationships are defined as follows:


- One User can be assigned to multiple Tasks (Many-to-Many relationship through TaskAssignment)
- One Task can be assigned to multiple Users (Many-to-Many relationship through TaskAssignment)
- One User can create multiple Projects (One-to-Many relationship)
- One Project can have multiple Tasks (One-to-Many relationship)
- One Task can have multiple Resource Assignments (One-to-Many relationship)
- One Resource can be assigned to multiple Tasks (One-to-Many relationship)


Please note that the ER diagram provided is a simplified representation of the entities and relationships in an online project management system. Additional attributes or relationships may be required depending on your specific system requirements.


I hope this description helps you visualize the connections between the entities in your online project management system.
