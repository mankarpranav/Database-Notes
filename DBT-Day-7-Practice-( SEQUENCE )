   /*> SEQUENCE -> ORACLE
   /*>
   /*> In MySQL, a sequence is a database object used to generate unique numeric values automatically. 
   It provides a sequential series of numbers that can be used as primary keys or other unique identifiers in tables. 
   However, it's important to note that as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, MySQL does not have built-in support 
   for sequences. Nevertheless, there are alternative approaches that can achieve similar functionality. Let's explore them:
   /*>
   /*> 1. AUTO_INCREMENT Column: One common method is to use the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute on an integer column in a table. 
   By defining this attribute on a column, MySQL automatically generates a unique value for that column whenever a new row 
   is inserted into the table. The sequence starts from 1 by default and increments by 1 for each new row.
   /*>
   /*>    Example:
   /*>    ```
   /*>    CREATE TABLE my_table (
   /*>      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   /*>      ...
   /*>    );
   /*>    ```
   /*>
   /*> 2. Triggers: Another approach is to use triggers, which are database objects that can be associated with a table 
   and automatically execute certain actions when specific events occur (e.g., before or after an INSERT operation). By 
   creating a trigger, you can manually generate and assign unique values to a specific column in a table.
   /*>
   /*>    Example:
   /*>    ```sql
   /*>    CREATE TRIGGER my_trigger
   /*>    BEFORE INSERT ON my_table
   /*>    FOR EACH ROW
   /*>    BEGIN
   /*>      SET NEW.id = (SELECT MAX(id) + 1 FROM my_table);
   /*>    END;
   /*>    ```
   /*>
   /*>    Note that this trigger example assigns the next available value by incrementing the maximum existing value by 1.
   However, this method may encounter issues in a multi-user environment where simultaneous inserts can lead to duplicate 
   values or conflicts.
   /*>
   /*> 3. Custom Implementation: If you require more control or flexibility, you can create your own custom implementation 
   of a sequence using tables and transactions. You would create a separate table to store the current sequence value and 
   use transactions to ensure atomicity and prevent conflicts when generating new values.
   /*>
   /*>    Example:
   /*>    ```sql
   /*>    CREATE TABLE my_sequence (
   /*>      value INT
   /*>    );
   /*>
   /*>    -- Insert initial value
   /*>    INSERT INTO my_sequence (value) VALUES (0);
   /*>
   /*>    -- Retrieve and increment value in a transaction
   /*>    START TRANSACTION;
   /*>    SELECT value FROM my_sequence FOR UPDATE;
   /*>    UPDATE my_sequence SET value = value + 1;
   /*>    COMMIT;
   /*>    ```
   /*>
   /*>    This approach allows you to have more control over the sequence generation process and handle complex scenarios. 
   However, it requires additional manual management and potential overhead.
   /*>
   /*> Remember that these alternatives aim to simulate sequence-like behavior in MySQL, as the database does not have a 
   native sequence object. Depending on your specific use case and requirements, one of these methods may be suitable for 
   your needs.
   /*>
   /*> SYNTAX:
   /*>
   /*> CREATE SEQUENCE name_of_sequence
   /*> INCREMENT BY number
   /*> START WITH DIFFERENCE_BETWEEN_NUMBERS
   /*> MAXVALUE LIMIT_VALUE
   /*> CYCLE    NOCYCLE
   /*> CACHE    NOCACHE;
   /*>
   /*> LAST TWO LINES ARE OPTIONAL.
